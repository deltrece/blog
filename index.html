        <h2>April is Autism Awareness Month</h2>
        <h3>April 1, 2023</h3>
        <p><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder</strong> (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. Some people
          with ASD have a known difference, such as a genetic condition. Other causes are not yet known. Scientists
          believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act together to change the most common ways people develop. We
          still have much to learn about these causes and how they impact people with ASD.<br>

          <br>People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other
          people. There is often nothing about how they look that sets them apart from other people. The abilities of
          people with ASD can vary significantly. For example, some people with ASD may have advanced conversation
          skills whereas others may be nonverbal. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others
          can work and live with little to no support. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html" target="_blank">Continue

        <h2>Libraries Are Life</h2>
        <h3>March 30, 2023</h3>
        <p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> Libraries. They are essential to learning and my favorite part of libraries are that
          they are FREE! <em>(Well mostly)</em> Public libraries have evolved over the years from the card catalog dewey
          decimal system to the ability to check out non-book items like tools and kitchen items. You may be able to
          obtain a library card virtually and have the ability to access online resources. That is what I did for my
          state's capital library system. If you are a resdient of Ohio, get your <a

        <h2>Stuffed Peppers Cravings</h2>
        <h3>March 25, 2023</h3>
        <p>For about a good two week stretch, I ate a lot of stuffed peppers. I made a variety of stuffings and
          flavorings and each and every one of them were delicious. I began by searching for what I can put on the
          inside of them and then began making them with what I had on stock. Items included rice, mushrooms, salsa,
          (both spicy and mild flavors), corn and plant based grounds at times. <a
